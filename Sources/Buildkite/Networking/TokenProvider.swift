/// Interface for a type that can provide different tokens depending on which API is used.
///
/// It isn't necessary to implement this yourself unless you want to use the same ``BuildkiteClient``
/// for different APIs and want to continue restricting scopes or the tokens are inherently incompatible. For example,
/// you cannot use a Test Analytics API with any other API, including the REST or GraphQL APIs. GraphQL API
/// tokens also require scopes that more responsibly-configured REST API tokens do not, and may be undesirable to
/// leverage in all cases.
///
/// In addition, implementing this protocol allows you to fine-tune the storage mechanism for your tokens. For example,
/// if you need to read your token dynamically from the keychain, it may be more adventageous to do that as part of a
/// ``TokenProvider`` implementation rather than tightly-coupling keychain raw string access directly to your
/// client instantiation.
public protocol TokenProvider: Sendable {
    /// Returns a token string for the given ``APIVersion``. This will usually be a fixed constant such as ``APIVersion/REST/v2`` or ``APIVersion/GraphQL/v1``, so you can switch on the values of one of these.
